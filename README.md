# Cream the Rabbit - Character Select
A redone version of the original [CS] Cream the Rabbit to faithfully add the character along with some extras features taken from Super Cream 64.

Tested on sm64coopdx 1.0.4 and above

## Features:
* Animations are now independent from the base model
* Added hovering action and fixed some network sync issues with it
* Added expressions when she gets a star and exits a painting
* A personal API made to easily integrate costume packs

## Costume packs
Due to the amount of costumes she has on Super Cream 64, a personal API was written to reuse most of the code used on the base character.
This allows to independently activate each pack before hosting, for example all packs can be disabled as well so only her base model can be selected.

Click on each pack to see a list of costumes included:
